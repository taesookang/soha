# Soha

A Restaurant web app which offers categorized food menu, events, photos of the restaurant, and link to reservation webpage. This is my first project with a CMS(Content Management System) tool and I chose to use [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/) among lots of CMS productions for my project, because they use GraphQL as data fetching method which I am quite familiar with.

## What I learned from this project
During working with GraphCMS, I felt it was amazingly convenient to use in that it offers intuitive UI which makes easier to create models and contents. Plus, it significantly reduces length of source code.

- How to create data models and contents in CMS & to fetch data using **GraphQL request**.
- How to use **webhook** to integrate CMS with Github for automated deploy when contents are added or removed.
- Understanding structure of **rich text** and how to render in React.
